# KerasCV API

**layers** can be used independently, or with the `keras.Model` class.  **layers**
implement specific self contained logic such as image data augmentation, regularization
during training, and more!

**metrics** are used for model evaluation.  KerasCV **metrics** can be used for both
train time and post training evaluation.  The can be used independently, or within the
standard `Model.fit()`, `Model.evaluate()`, `Model.predict()` flow.
